# Executive Summary
This report provides an overview and analysis of the provided CSV files: customers.csv, products.csv, and orders.csv. The goal is to integrate these datasets to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior and product sales. A proposed merge strategy is outlined, including join keys, join types, and handling of missing values.

# Data Overview
The datasets contain information about customers, products, and orders. The customers.csv file likely contains customer demographic information, products.csv contains product details, and orders.csv contains transactional data. The file sizes are relatively small, with customers.csv and products.csv being 0.5 KB each, and orders.csv being 0.4 KB.

# Detailed Analysis
Based on the file names and typical schema conventions, the following columns are inferred:
- customers.csv: customer_id, name, email, address
- products.csv: product_id, name, description, price
- orders.csv: order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_date, quantity

A proposed merge strategy involves joining the orders.csv file with customers.csv and products.csv using the customer_id and product_id columns, respectively. The join type will be an inner join to ensure that only matching records are included in the merged dataset.

To handle missing values, a threshold will be set to determine the minimum number of required fields. Type mismatches will be addressed by converting data types to the most suitable format.

# Key Findings
The merged dataset will provide valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior, including:
- Which products are most popular among customers
- Customer demographics and purchasing patterns
- Product sales trends and revenue

Example merge using pandas:
```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.name, products.name, orders.order_date, orders.quantity
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
INNER JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
```
Alternatively, using pandas merge:
```python
import pandas as pd

orders = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')
customers = pd.read_csv('customers.csv')
products = pd.read_csv('products.csv')

merged_data = pd.merge(orders, customers, on='customer_id')
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, products, on='product_id')
```

# Conclusion
The proposed merge strategy will enable the integration of the customers, products, and orders datasets, providing a comprehensive view of customer purchasing behavior and product sales. The merged dataset will be useful for business intelligence and data-driven decision-making. Further analysis can be performed to identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
