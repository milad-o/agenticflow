# Nature Overview

Nature encompasses ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate dynamics. Key themes include conservation, resilience, and interdependence among species and habitats.

- Biodiversity supports ecosystem services (pollination, water filtration).
- Climate change introduces stressors (temperature rise, extreme weather).
- Conservation strategies: protected areas, restoration, sustainable use.
