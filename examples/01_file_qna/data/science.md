Science advances through hypothesis, experimentation, and peer review. Notable themes include reproducibility, measurement, and models that explain and predict phenomena.

- The scientific method: observation, hypothesis, test, analysis.
- Reproducibility and open data improve reliability.
- Interdisciplinarity (e.g., biophysics, computational social science).
