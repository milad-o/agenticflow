# Data Integration Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides an analysis of three CSV files: `customers.csv`, `products.csv`, and `orders.csv`. The objective is to integrate these datasets into a unified format for comprehensive business insights. The analysis includes data overview, detailed join strategy, key findings, and conclusions.

## Data Overview

### File Descriptions
- **customers.csv**: Contains customer information.
- **products.csv**: Lists product details.
- **orders.csv**: Records order history with references to customers and products.

### Schema Inference
- `customers.csv`:
  - Columns: `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`
- `products.csv`:
  - Columns: `product_id`, `name`, `category`, `price`
- `orders.csv`:
  - Columns: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`

## Detailed Analysis

### Join Strategy
To integrate these datasets, we will perform a series of joins based on the common keys between tables.

#### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Join customers and orders**: Use `customer_id` as the key.
2. **Join products to the result from step 1**: Use `product_id` as the key.

### Join Types and Mappings
- **Inner Join** on `customer_id` between `customers.csv` and `orders.csv`.
- **Inner Join** on `product_id` between the result of step 1 and `products.csv`.

#### Example SQL Query
```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    p.product_id,
    p.name,
    o.quantity
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
INNER JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
```

#### Handling Missing Values and Type Mismatches
- **Missing Values**: Use `LEFT JOIN` to ensure all customer records are included, even if there are no corresponding order records.
- **Type Mismatch**: Ensure data types match (e.g., integer for IDs). Convert types where necessary.

## Key Findings

1. **Customer Orders Analysis**:
   - Identify top customers by total quantity of orders.
   - Analyze the distribution of products across different customer segments.

2. **Product Performance**:
   - Determine best-selling products based on order quantities.
   - Evaluate product categories in terms of sales volume and revenue.

3. **Sales Trends**:
   - Track changes in sales over time by aggregating data monthly or quarterly.

## Conclusion

The integration of the `customers.csv`, `products.csv`, and `orders.csv` datasets will provide a comprehensive view of customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends. The proposed join strategy ensures that all relevant data is included while maintaining accuracy through proper handling of missing values and type mismatches. This integrated dataset can support strategic business decisions by offering insights into customer preferences and product success.

Further analysis could include time-series forecasting, segmentation analysis, and predictive modeling to enhance the utility of these integrated datasets.
