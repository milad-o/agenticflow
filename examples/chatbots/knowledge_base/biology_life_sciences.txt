The Science of Life: Biology and Evolution

Biology explores the incredible diversity of life on Earth and the processes that sustain it, from the smallest microorganisms to complex multicellular organisms like humans.

Cell Biology:
- All living things are made of cells, the basic unit of life. Some organisms are single-celled while others contain trillions of cells working together.
- Plant cells have cell walls and chloroplasts for photosynthesis. The cell wall provides structure, while chloroplasts capture sunlight to make food.
- Animal cells have mitochondria, the "powerhouses" that produce energy through cellular respiration. A single cell can contain hundreds of mitochondria.
- DNA contains the genetic instructions for building and maintaining life. It's stored in the nucleus and consists of four chemical bases: A, T, G, and C.

Evolution and Adaptation:
- Natural selection favors traits that help organisms survive and reproduce in their environment. Over time, these advantageous traits become more common in populations.
- Species evolve over time through mutations and environmental pressures. Evolution is not "survival of the fittest" but "survival of the best adapted."
- Fossil records show how life has changed over millions of years, from simple single-celled organisms to complex multicellular life.
- Common ancestry explains why all life shares similar DNA and cellular structures. Humans share 50% of their DNA with bananas and 98.8% with chimpanzees.

Ecosystems and Biodiversity:
- Food webs show how energy flows from producers (plants) to primary consumers (herbivores) to secondary consumers (carnivores) to decomposers.
- Keystone species have disproportionate effects on their ecosystems. Removing a keystone species can cause the entire ecosystem to collapse.
- Biodiversity provides ecosystem stability and resilience. More diverse ecosystems are better able to withstand environmental changes.
- Human activities are causing the sixth mass extinction event, with species disappearing 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than natural background rates.

Human Biology:
- The human brain contains about 86 billion neurons connected by trillions of synapses. It uses about 20% of the body's total energy despite being only 2% of body weight.
- The heart beats about 100,000 times per day, pumping 2,000 gallons of blood through 60,000 miles of blood vessels.
- The immune system recognizes and fights millions of different threats using specialized white blood cells that can remember previous infections.
- Humans share 99.9% of their DNA with each other, despite our visible differences. The 0.1% difference accounts for all human genetic variation.

Plant Life:
- Photosynthesis converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process provides energy for nearly all life on Earth.
- Trees communicate through underground fungal networks called mycorrhizae, sharing nutrients and information about threats.
- Some plants can live for thousands of years, like bristlecone pines in California that are over 4,000 years old.
- Flowering plants and their pollinators co-evolved together over millions of years, creating intricate relationships of mutual dependence.

Genetics and Heredity:
- Genes are segments of DNA that code for specific traits. Humans have about 20,000-25,000 genes.
- Mendel's laws of inheritance explain how traits are passed from parents to offspring through dominant and recessive alleles.
- Genetic mutations provide the raw material for evolution. Most mutations are neutral, some are harmful, and a few are beneficial.
- Epigenetics shows that environmental factors can influence gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself.

Microbiology:
- Bacteria are single-celled organisms without a nucleus. Some cause disease, but many are beneficial or essential for life.
- Viruses are not technically alive - they require host cells to reproduce and consist of genetic material wrapped in protein.
- The human body contains roughly equal numbers of human cells and bacterial cells, forming a complex ecosystem called the microbiome.
- Antibiotics work by targeting specific features of bacterial cells, such as cell wall synthesis or protein production.

Amazing Biology Facts:
- Your body produces 25 million new cells every second
- Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood
- A single teaspoon of soil contains more organisms than there are people on Earth
- Tardigrades (water bears) can survive in the vacuum of space and temperatures close to absolute zero
- Some jellyfish are biologically immortal and can reverse their aging process
