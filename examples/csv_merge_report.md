# Data Integration Report
==========================

## Executive Summary
-------------------

This report presents an analysis of the provided CSV files, `department.csv` and `employees.csv`. The goal is to understand the data, identify potential issues, and propose a merge strategy to integrate the two datasets.

## Data Overview
----------------

### department.csv

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| department_id | int | Unique identifier for each department |
| department_name | string | Name of the department |

### employees.csv

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| employee_id | int | Unique identifier for each employee |
| department_id | int | Foreign key referencing the department_id in department.csv |
| employee_name | string | Name of the employee |
| job_title | string | Job title of the employee |

## Detailed Analysis
-------------------

Upon reviewing the data, we notice the following:

* Both datasets have a unique identifier column (`department_id` in department.csv and `employee_id` in employees.csv).
* The `department_id` column in employees.csv is a foreign key referencing the `department_id` column in department.csv.
* There are no missing values or type mismatches in either dataset.

## Merge Strategy
----------------

Based on the analysis, we propose the following merge strategy:

* **Join Type:** Inner Join
* **Join Key:** `department_id`
* **Column Mappings/Renames:**
	+ `department_id` in employees.csv will be joined with `department_id` in department.csv
* **Handling of Missing Values:** None, as there are no missing values in either dataset
* **Handling of Type Mismatches:** None, as there are no type mismatches in either dataset

## Example Merge
----------------

Here is an example of how to merge the two datasets using SQL:
```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN department d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
Or using pandas in Python:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
department_df = pd.read_csv('department.csv')
employees_df = pd.read_csv('employees.csv')

# Merge the datasets
merged_df = pd.merge(employees_df, department_df, on='department_id')

# Print the merged dataset
print(merged_df)
```
## Key Findings
----------------

* The two datasets can be successfully merged using an inner join on the `department_id` column.
* There are no missing values or type mismatches in either dataset.

## Conclusion
--------------

In conclusion, the proposed merge strategy and example merge demonstrate a successful integration of the `department.csv` and `employees.csv` datasets. The merged dataset can be used for further analysis and reporting.
