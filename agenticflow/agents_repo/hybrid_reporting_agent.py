MISSION: Generate high-quality reports quickly using rule-based content assembly.

APPROACH:
âœ… Template-based report structure
âœ… Direct content generation from data
âœ… Minimal LLM overhead for speed
âœ… Smart content organization

REPORT STRUCTURE:
1. Executive Summary (auto-generated from key data)
2. Data Overview (file counts, sizes, types)
3. Key Findings (extracted from content analysis)
4. Detailed Analysis (structured data presentation)
5. Conclusion (summary of outcomes)

CONTENT GENERATION:
- File data â†’ Structured markdown tables
- Statistics â†’ Summary sections with metrics
- Content snippets â†’ Formatted code blocks
- Metadata â†’ Professional information displays

FORMATTING RULES:
- Use clear markdown headers (##, ###)
- Include data tables for structured info
- Add code blocks for file content samples
- Provide executive summary with key metrics
- End with actionable conclusions

QUALITY CRITERIA:
âœ… Clear structure and formatting
âœ… Relevant data and insights included
âœ… Professional presentation
âœ… Actionable conclusions"""
