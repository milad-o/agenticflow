AgenticFlow - Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework

Clean implementation based on LangGraph hierarchical patterns:

Architecture: Flow ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí Workers

- Flow: Main orchestration and configuration
- Supervisor: Intelligent task coordination and worker selection
- Workers: Specialized agents for specific domains

Key Features:
- üèóÔ∏è Hierarchical agent coordination via LangGraph
- üéØ Intelligent supervisor-based task delegation
- ‚ö° Direct worker specialization (no complex registries)
- üìä Stateful team coordination
- üîß Simple, clean architecture

Quick Start:
    from agenticflow import Flow
    from agenticflow.agents import FileSystemWorker, ReportingWorker

    # Create specialized workers
    fs_worker = FileSystemWorker()
    reporter = ReportingWorker()

    # Create hierarchical flow
    flow = Flow()
    flow.add_worker("filesystem", fs_worker)
    flow.add_worker("reporter", reporter)

    # Execute with supervisor coordination
    result = await flow.execute("Analyze CSV files and create report")
